# About / Vision

## Vision

SMILE proposes **soundscape engineering** as a practical engineering paradigm: a workflow that unifies physical acoustics, metamaterial design, machine learning, and human perception.

Rather than optimizing only for **sound pressure level** (dB), we consider what people **actually experience**—comfort, pleasantness, and health impacts—while maintaining rigorous physical modeling.

## Scientific idea (short)

1. **Model & simulate** sound fields and structural-acoustic interactions with high fidelity.
2. **Inverse-design metamaterials** using ML-driven optimization and generative design.
3. **Validate perceptual outcomes** using virtual reality (VR) soundscape evaluation and public participation.
4. Iterate to create a **closed loop**: perception → target → design → prototype → perception.

- Physical acoustics / wave propagation
