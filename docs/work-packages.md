# Work Packages

This page will be populated based on the final project plan.

## WP structure (draft)

- **WP1 — Soundscape targets & perceptual metrics**
  - Define context-specific target soundscapes
  - Design evaluation protocols (VR, listening tests)

- **WP2 — Physical modeling & simulation**
  - Structural–acoustic modeling for relevant use cases
  - Validation against experiments / reference scenarios

- **WP3 — Metamaterial concepts & design space**
  - Broadband noise control concepts
  - Adaptive/topological approaches for robust performance

- **WP4 — ML-driven inverse design loop**
  - Optimization / generative design for metamaterial structures
  - Perceptually-driven objective functions

- **WP5 — Prototyping, demonstrators & guidelines**
  - Prototypes and demonstrators
  - Guidelines for engineering practice and dissemination
