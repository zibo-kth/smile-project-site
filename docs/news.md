- **Seed funding for collaboration (Stockholm–Trio–UCL)** — We received support from the *Stockholm Trio–UCL Seed Fund* to enable collaborative research activities connected to SMILE, including joint work on sustainable soundscape solutions (indoor comfort and outdoor urban spaces).

If you have an event to announce (workshop, invited talk, conference presentation), send it to Zibo and it will be added here.
